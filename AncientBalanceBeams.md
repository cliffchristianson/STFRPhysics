# Let me tell you a story...

There's this guy, bored, alone, and he finds a way to make a balance beam scale.  
He uses it measure things, and he finds that there's a certain angle that the beam 
scale goes to for a certain ratio of things he measures.  It doesn't matter what he measures: rocks,
apples, leaves, it doesn't matter as long as they are all roughly the same weight, the tilt of the
scale is always the same.
