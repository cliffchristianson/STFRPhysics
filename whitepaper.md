Hm. what do I want it to show...
I want 
  - to present this new system of observing curvatures/rotations.
    - the new system is less calculation and has greater accuracy than existing systems.
    - THere was a paper about using log-quaternions in long IK chains, and the superior solve time was shown.
    - It has been applied for updating skinning on models, but had some corner cases that were not handled correctly; this provides a correction for that. (Again more FPS, less work)

  - How this can be applied in places like differential geometry; rather than the Frenet frame; and complex analysis.

  - I want to clearly show what path needs to be filled in next
    - There is a curvature for the twist of a point at any given sphere... I just don't have specifically what that is.
