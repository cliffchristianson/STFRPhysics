Hm. what do I want it to show...
I want 
1) to present this new system of observing curvatures/rotations.
   1a) the new system is less calculation and has greater accuracy than existing systems.  
   1b) THere was a paper about using log-quaternions in long IK chains, and the superior solve time was shown.
   1c) It has been applied for updating skinning on models, but had some corner cases that were not handled correctly; this provides a correction for that. (Again more FPS, less work)

1.5) How this can be applied in places like differential geometry; rather than the Frenet frame; and complex analysis.

2) I want to clearly show what path needs to be filled in next
