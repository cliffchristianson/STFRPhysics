	<p>I found a copy of <a href="https://inspirehep.net/files/67578c1d19ace842e25198fa5675442e">Bell's paper</a>, in which he even makes the case
	for a spin axis as the hidden variable.  Then he proceeds in (10) to declare the wrong sum.

	The actual sum is 1-(x/(pi-x)).  <a href="https://github.com/d3x0r/STFRPhysics/blob/master/LHV_Theory.md#scoring-in-game">As explained here</a>

	<p>The ratio of blue to green is the actual ratio one would expect.

	<p>There are two half circle arcs, one that's fixed, with a line across the bottom, and a 180 degree arc above.  The second rotates towards
        the left, and ends at the blue triangle.  The portion that cannot correlate with filters is removed from both arcs.  Then of those that make 
	it through the arc, the amount of extended overlap is removed again.  The ratio of actual occurances to possible occurances is <code>pi-2x / pi-x</code> or <code>1-x/(pi-x)</code>.

	<H2>Polarizar Graph(left)</H2>

	<p>The left graph is polarizers, the slider rotates through 90 degrees.  The slider to the left is 0 degrees and middle is 45 degrees.
         At 45 degrees, the preferred correlation becomes non-correlation; and the divisor for how much goes through continues to increase.  This is
	noted with a darker color.	

	<p> 
<pre><code> 
x = degrees/90;

if( 1-2*x > 0 )  // 0 to 45 degrees is > 0  45 to 90 degrees is < 0
	percent = (100/4 * (1+(1-2*x)/(1-x)))  // divisor slowly decreases to 0.5
else
	percent = (100/4 * (1-x)/x)   // divisor slowly increases after 0.5
</code></pre>
