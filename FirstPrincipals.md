
Rotation Vector

- scaled normal notation : θ(x,y,z)
- vector notation : (xθ, yθ, zθ)
- rotation vector space is typically a region around identity, within a range of 2pi.  Rotating around any axis by 2pi the  represented frame is the same as 0.
  - Beyond this shell, it may be possible to apply a linear offset and hop orbits; or perhaps a resonant spin that happens to come around a parallel axis.

Whether scaled-normal or vector notation, they represent the same element of the rotation vector space.

- axis-angle (rotation) may be represented by either of the previous two equivalent values.

Vectors add as expected from geometry.

Scaled normals need to be converted to vector notation before addition.

Rotating a rotating vector performs a co-mutation between the original rotation vector and the applied rotation.


What else do you need to know? WTF? Why is this so difficult?




















- Photons transmit torque.  (light, particles that are in a non material state)

- Mass transmits linear momentum.
